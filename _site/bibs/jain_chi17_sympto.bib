abstract = {Mental disorder has been shrouded as a stigma and disregarded as a secondary issue to physical health. It has become a major contributor to morbidity, disability and at times, fatality. Through our research, we show that the data generated through our daily interaction with technology has consistent patterns to identify symptoms in prodromal phase of degrading mental health. We propose a methodological data driven system that will help to raise an early alarm on the onset of symptoms of potential psychiatric disorders. The system collects the user's data from different human-computer interfaces to create a fine-grain electronic health portfolio, which can assist doctors in differential diagnosis as well as prognosis.},
